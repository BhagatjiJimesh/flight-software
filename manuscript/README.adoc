= Manuscript

This directory contains the metamodel (LinkML schema) and model (LinkML data) used validating and generating manuscript documents for the SciTech conference.

Note: Do not edit `manuscript-example.yaml` as it is used for testing the schema validator and document generators.

== Requirements

- https://github.com/linkml/linkml[LinkML]
- https://github.com/mattrobenolt/jinja2-cli[jinja2-cli]
- https://www.tug.org/texlive/[TeX Live] - required for generating PDF documents from LaTeX

== Usage

Note: The `buildDocs.sh` script, found in the project root directory, can also be used in place of the following for model validation and document generation of the SciTech manuscript.

=== Validate manuscript model

From the project root directory, run the following `linkml-validate` command to validate the manuscript model:

[source,bash]
----
linkml-validate -s manuscript/manuscript-schema.yaml manuscript/manuscript-example-data.yaml
----

=== Generate LaTeX and PDF document of manuscript

From project root directory, run the following `jinja2` command to generate a LaTeX document from the manuscript model:

[source,bash]
----
jinja2 -o dist/manuscript-example.tex templates/manuscript.tex.jinja2 manuscript/manuscript-example-data.yaml
----

Copy files needed for LaTeX formatting to the `dist/` directory:

[source,bash]
----
cp -t dist/ manuscript/*.tex manuscript/*.bib manuscript/*.bst manuscript/*.cls assets/*
----

From the `dist/` directory, run the following `pdflatex` command to generate a PDF document of from the LaTeX manuscript, using pdflatex template:

[source,bash]
----
pdflatex manuscript-example.tex
----
